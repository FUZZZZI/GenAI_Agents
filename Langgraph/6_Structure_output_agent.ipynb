    "**A Structured Output Agent in LangChain (or other LLM frameworks) refers to an agent that produces responses in a specific structured format, such as JSON, dictionaries, or other structured data types. These agents are particularly useful when you want to ensure that your responses conform to a defined schema, making it easier to parse, validate, and utilize in downstream applications.**\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Why Use a Structured Output Agent?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Controlled Responses: Ensures that the outputs follow a specific format, reducing ambiguity.\n",
    "- Data Validation: Useful when you want the model output to fit predefined structures, like for APIs or database entries.\n",
    "- Automation: Makes integration with systems like dashboards, ETL pipelines, or business workflows easier."

    "#### The BaseModel class is a core component of Pydantic, which is used extensively in Python applications for data validation, type checking, and parsing. It's particularly useful when working with APIs, web frameworks like FastAPI, and other scenarios where you need to enforce data structure and ensure data integrity.\n",

    "- Class Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "- CityDetails inherits from BaseModel, making it a data validation model.\n",
    "- Fields with Type Annotations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- state_name: A string representing the state name of a city.\n",

    "\n",
    "- The model validates and structures data related to cities.\n",
    "- Useful for ensuring that any data related to cities has the correct structure before processing.\n",

Design and Construction of the Taj Mahal\\\\nNamed the Taj Mahal in honor of Mumtaz Mahal, the mausoleum was constructed of white marble inlaid with semi-precious stones (including jade, crystal, lapis lazuli, amethyst and turquoise) forming intricate designs in a technique known as pietra dura.\\\\n In accordance with the traditions of Islam, verses from the Quran were inscribed in calligraphy on the arched entrances to the mausoleum, in addition to numerous other sections of the complex.\\\\n The rest of the Taj Mahal complex included a main gateway of red sandstone and a square garden divided into quarters by long pools of water, as well as a red sandstone mosque and an identical building called a jawab (or “mirror”) directly across from the mosque. Shah Jahan lived out the last years of his life under house arrest in a tower of the Red Fort at Agra, with a view of the majestic resting place he had constructed for his wife; when he died in 1666, he was buried next to her.\\\\n\"}, {\"url\": \"https://www.thoughtco.com/the-taj-mahal-1434536\", \"content\": \"The Taj Mahal is a breathtaking white-marble mausoleum commissioned by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan for his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal.
